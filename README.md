This project is, at its heart, a love letter. It was built with patience, curiosity, and the kind of care that comes from loving something deeply and wanting it to be seen, understood, and appreciated. Every detail carries intention, every choice reflects devotion, and every imperfection is part of the story. If you feel something while exploring this—comfort, joy, wonder, or connection—then this project has done what love always hopes to do: reach beyond itself and meet you where you are.
